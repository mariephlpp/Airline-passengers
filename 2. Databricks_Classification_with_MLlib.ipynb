The algorithm\npartitions the individuals into groups of individuals that are as similar as possible in terms of\nthe variable to be predicted. The result is a tree that reveals hierarchical relationships between\nthe variables. The decision tree is an iterative algorithm that, at each iteration, will split the\nindividuals into groups to explain the target variable. The first split is obtained by choosing\nthe explanatory variable that allows the best separation of the individuals contained in the\ntrain set (this is called the root of the tree). This split results in sub-populations corresponding\nto the first node of the tree. This splitting process is then repeated several times for each\nsub-population until the splitting process is stopped.\n - **Random forest**: Random forests can be used to solve classification problems. This method is able to\novercome the disadvantages associated with simple decision trees while retaining the advantages. The key to the performance of random forests is the way in which each of the decision trees that make up the forest are created. There are two random selection steps to form the forest trees. The first randomly selects, with replacement, data from the train set. As a result, for each of the trees, a different subset of the variables is used to develop the model for that decision tree. The remaining data is used to test the accuracy of the tree. The second random sampling step is related to the splitting conditions for each node of the tree. At each node, a subset of predictor variables is randomly selected to create the binary rule.\n - **Gradient-boosted tree**: It is an ensemble machine learning algorithm which means that with a single model, one get aggregated output from several models. The ensemble is here constructed from decision tree models. It means that decision trees are built sequentially and added to the ensemble. Each decision tree model is fitted each time to reduce the prediction error of the previous tree, it is the principle of boosting. The loss function and gradient descent optimization algorithms are used for the fitting. If a tree is not good enough then it is pruned until it is good enough and if it is never the case then it isn’t added to the ensemble."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7074be42-2536-41d8-ac81-cce43acf4940"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To know how good a model is, several metrics can be used.
